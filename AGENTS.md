# Notes for Coding Agents

Only non-obvious traps live here — things you cannot learn from the project
structure. Add new ones as they are found.

## Offline compile verification (`/tmp/opencode/harness`)

C# changes are verified outside the editor with a generated .NET harness:

- Regenerate: `python3 /tmp/opencode/gen_harness2.py` (rebuilds csprojs against live `Assets/Scripts`)
- **New `.cs` files are INVISIBLE to the harness until regen** — a stale csproj silently skips them, so their errors only surface in the editor (`MainMenuWorldController.cs` hid three missing-using bugs this way). Always regen after creating files.
- Build: `cd /tmp/opencode/harness && dotnet build All.csproj -v q -nologo`

**Known blind spot:** the harness compiles against a UnityEngine *reference stub*,
not the real Unity 6 assemblies. It cannot catch Unity-version-specific API
differences. Example that slipped through (fixed in commit `e330257c`):
`Resolution.refreshRateRatio.value` is a `double` in Unity 6 but `float` in the
stub, so `Mathf.RoundToInt(value)` passed the harness but failed in the editor
with CS1503 (double → float).

**Rule:** a clean harness build is necessary but not sufficient. After any code
change, confirm zero `error CS` lines in the editor's `Logs/Editor.log`
(or ask the user for the Console output) before considering the change done.

## Verification workflow

1. Harness build (fast, catches 99% of issues)
2. Editor refocus by the user → read `Logs/Editor.log` for real-Unity compile errors
3. Runtime/rendering issues are verified by the user in Play mode or on device

Headless Unity does not work in this environment (licensing client fails,
exit 198) — the user performs all editor actions.

## Non-obvious traps

- **Story universes are baked INTO their scene files:** `unchartered_space.unity`
  (and `a_wormhole_too_far.unity`) contain fully-expanded runtime-named copies
  of every sector's content (`GasCloud_Gas Cloud Cool Blue_-1_No-faction`,
  `AsteroidCluster__-1_No-faction`, ...) — editing the sector PREFABS in
  `Resources/prefabs/worlddata/sectors/` does NOT change the story scenarios.
  The prefabs only serve battles (GUID references from `ScenarioInfoBattle*`)
  and name-based loading (`EngineASX.LoadSectorPrefabs`). Sector-content edits
  for story scenarios must edit the .unity scene too. Scene YAML uses the same
  block structure as prefabs; when deleting objects, scrub `m_Children`
  (indentation-agnostic) and verify no surviving block references the dead
  fileIDs (missions/dialogs reference units).
- **Sun/backdrop render order:** the sun quads (layer 16, queue 3000)
  sit at 0.95×far (~8075); nebula quads (layer 0) were ALSO queue 3000,
  so transparent distance-sort drew nearer nebulae OVER the sun ("sun
  clips into the skybox", worse at 1.6× size). All 338 nebula materials
  are now queue 2999 — the sun always draws after the backdrop, while
  gameplay particles (3000) still distance-sort over it correctly.
- **Mipmap streaming is OFF for good — budget starvation, not
  reduction depth.** This game's working set is enormous (an Instant
  Action capital fleet ≈ 2.3GB+ of 2K maps); any mobile-sane budget
  starves the streamer and textures sit at their smallest loaded mip
  = "white ships". Verified matrix: OFF=fine, 256MB=white (even
  menu), 768-2048MB=white (Instant Action), 4096MB=fine, OFF=fine.
  Mipmaps themselves stay ON (all 746 textures) — only streaming is
  disabled. Do not re-enable.
- **Script GUIDs are deterministic:** `Guid(MD5(assemblyName + namespace + className))`
  (AssetRipper decompile scheme). Never regenerate .meta files; renaming
  namespaces/assemblies is safe because GUIDs live in the .meta files, but the
  scheme no longer matches names after the `Pixelfactor.*` → `OpenFrontier.*` rename.
- **The starfield is pinned at the WORLD ORIGIN, not the camera:**
  `Imphenzia.SpaceForUnity.StaticStars.LateUpdate` force-pins its
  20000-unit-wide star-cube mesh to `Vector3.zero` every frame (DLL,
  uneditable). The main view survives because the DeepSpace "SpaceCamera"
  sits at the sector anchor with far plane 100000 and rotation following
  the main camera (parented under the `SkyboxCamera` object, driven by
  `GameController.LateUpdate`). Nebulae are world-pinned too: they live
  under `ActiveSectorDataGeneric`'s transform — the `PositionAtCamera`
  object is vestigial (it pins only itself; nothing is parented under
  it). Anything that renders the backdrop from a flying-camera position
  (reflection probes!) gets a lopsided or missing sky — capture from the
  SECTOR ANCHOR instead (see `SpaceReflectionProbe`), with far plane
  ~100000.
- **Cameras instantiated mid-scene become rogue BASE cameras in URP:**
  `UrpCameraStacker` only restacks on scene load, so any prefab spawned
  with an enabled Camera (e.g. WormholeAnim) renders AFTER the stack as
  its own base camera — with clear flags that can wipe the frame to black
  (this blacked out the wormhole transition; the anim's camera is now
  disabled in the prefab). Never spawn enabled cameras at runtime unless
  they are explicitly stacked.
- **Play-mode edits to the URP asset can PERSIST in the editor:**
  `ShadowQualitySync` writes `mainLightShadowmapResolution` at runtime;
  the editor re-serialized the asset mid-session and the value stuck
  (4096), while an unrelated setting (`m_PrefilterSoftShadows`) silently
  reverted. After play sessions, diff `Assets/Settings/OpenFrontier-URP.asset`
  before committing — accept intentional drift, restore the rest.
- **No Unity native calls in MonoBehaviour field initializers / static
  constructors** (`new MaterialPropertyBlock()`, `LayerMask.NameToLayer`,
  etc.): `CreateImpl is not allowed to be called from a MonoBehaviour
  constructor` → `TypeInitializationException` poisons the WHOLE type
  (every use throws). Lazy-init with a null check instead
  (`ShieldHitRenderer` was bitten — shield hits errored and rendered
  white/black).
- **URP material postprocessor strips hand-edited YAML** for materials whose
  shader has a known URP ShaderID. Recreate those materials natively via the
  `Material` API; never hand-edit their YAML.
- **The BIRP project** (`InterstellarPilot - Open Frontier BIRP`, sibling
  directory) is a read-only reference of the original game — never modify it.
- **Soft particles are standardized Near=1/Far=0** (empirically verified on
  this OpenGL stack; URP's formula reads 0 behind empty space here).
  Do NOT write new soft-particle fades against `_CameraDepthTexture` —
  `sceneZ` reads ~0 behind open space and any `sceneZ - eyeZ` fade kills
  alpha (this made the legacy-particle additive shaders render lasers
  invisibly; their fade is now a passthrough).
- **`Screen.dpi` can return 0** (Android foldables, Linux editor). Never feed
  it into touch/drag thresholds directly — it once set
  `EventSystem.pixelDragThreshold` to 0 and ate every tap on the sector map.
  Use `OpenFrontier.ScreenDpi.Value` (Screen.dpi → JNI DisplayMetrics → 200
  fallback). Fingers.dll reads `Screen.dpi` in its Awake and falls back to
  its serialized DefaultDPI with a red error; `FingersDpiFix` on the
  GameController prefab's EventSystem object overrides `DeviceInfo` after
  each scene load. The one-time red error at startup is cosmetic and cannot
  be silenced without patching the DLL.
- **Only `Assets/Scripts/OpenFrontier/OpenFrontier.asmdef` references
  `Unity.RenderPipelines.Universal.Runtime`** — any new script touching URP
  types (`UniversalRenderPipelineAsset`, etc.) MUST live in the OpenFrontier
  assembly. The harness links every package into every csproj, so a missing
  asmdef reference passes the harness and fails in the editor with CS0234
  (`ShadowQualitySync` was bitten by this). The Core RP assembly
  (`Unity.RenderPipelines.Core.Runtime`, home of `Volume`/`VolumeProfile`)
  is referenced separately — `PostProcessingQualitySync` needed it added.
- **uGUI positions on ScreenSpace-Overlay canvases are in screen pixels**;
  any hit-test radius authored in "pixels" must be multiplied by
  `Canvas.scaleFactor` or it shrinks physically on high-DPI screens (see
  `SectorMapUnitSelector`).
- **`OpenFrontier.LegacyInput` is a shim over the NEW Input System**, not
  `UnityEngine.Input`: `Mouse.current` is null/stale on touch-only devices,
  so `mousePosition` must mirror the primary touch (fixed in the shim —
  keep that behaviour when migrating the remaining ~60 call sites).
- **No Unity native calls in MonoBehaviour field initializers / static
  constructors** (`LayerMask.NameToLayer`, `Shader.Find`, etc.): type
  initialization can run during serialization, where native calls are
  forbidden — the resulting `TypeInitializationException` poisons the
  whole type (every `AddComponent` fails silently). Look them up lazily
  in Awake/OnEnable. The harness cannot catch this; check Editor.log for
  "is not allowed to be called from a MonoBehaviour constructor".
